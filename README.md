**Prepared by:** Arsen Tagibekov
**Date:** March, 2025

This proejct explores sales, customer behavior, and discounting strategy at UrbanMart using the public Superstore dataset. The goal was to identify profit leaks, segment customers, and recommend actionable improvements. Deliverables include data cleaning workflows, exploratory analysis, KPI definitions, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Key Insights
- Gross Revenue: ~$2.3M | Profit Margin: ~12.5% | Average Order Value: ~$458
- Unprofitable sub-categories: Tables, Bookcases
- Home Office segment = most profitable; Corporate = high volume, lower margin
- West region leads in sales; South region suffers from discount-heavy, low-margin orders
- Clear negative correlation between discount levels and profitability

## Recommendations
- Cut or review low-margin products (e.g., Machines, Tables)
- Promote Phones, Binders, Accessories
- Limit discounts > 20% on weak-margin items
- Focus marketing on Home Office segment
- Replicate West region strategy in weaker zones
